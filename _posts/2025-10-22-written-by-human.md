I am noticing myself getting repulsed quickly by texts, articles or any content once I know it has been produced by AI instead of a human; even though the information could be equally useful if not better in quality, it feels like I was cheated into consuming it and I haaate it!

I am sure most of you felt this already with them em dashes everywhere! so, from now on, I am not gonna use AI in any of my writings on this site, so expect more typos and grammar hell everywhere, fellow human.
