Cross-Site Scripting (**XSS**) is a security vulnerability in web applications where attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. 

There are three main types of XSS:

## Stored XSS
Malicious scripts are permanently stored on the target server, impacting all users who view the affected page. 

**Example:** Attacker injects a script into a comment on a website, and anyone viewing that comment becomes a victim.

## Reflected XSS
 Malicious scripts are embedded in a URL and only affect users who click on a specially crafted link. 

**Example:** Attacker sends a phishing email with a link containing a script, and users who click on the link inadvertently execute the script.

## DOM-based XSS
The attack occurs in the Document Object Model (DOM) of a web page. Malicious scripts manipulate the DOM, leading to undesired outcomes. 

**Example:** Attacker injects a script that modifies the page's content directly through client-side scripting.
