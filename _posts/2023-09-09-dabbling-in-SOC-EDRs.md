### Definitions
A Security Operations Center (SOC) is the centralized unit within an organization that focuses on identifying, investigating, and responding to cybersecurity threats. It employs a dedicated team equipped with specialized technology and processes to monitor, analyze, and ensure the security of the organization's information assets around the clock.

Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) is a cybersecurity solution that monitors endpoint devices (such as computers, mobile devices, and servers) to detect and respond to threats. It collects and analyzes data on endpoint activities, providing organizations with the tools to identify suspicious behavior and automate responses to mitigate potential security incidents.

### So you want to be a SOC Analyst Tutorial
I stumbled upon this excellent tutorial by [Eric Capuano](https://substack.com/@ecapuano) on how to quickly get up to speed for SOC work.

It was a fun exercise for an afternoon, and I definitely recommend checking it out.

### Walkthrough
I also recommend watching the following YouTube videos where the blog author is [interviewed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9RsKDIGKvc) and Gerald Auger [walks through](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOzihldLz7U) the above series.
