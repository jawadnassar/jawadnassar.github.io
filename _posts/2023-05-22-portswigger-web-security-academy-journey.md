Hello! I will be focusing on application security for a while, starting with the [PortSwigger Web Security Academy Tutorials](https://portswigger.net/web-security/learning-path){:target="_blank"}. I'll complement this with reading [The Web Application Hacker's Handbook, 2nd Edition by Dafydd Stuttard and Marcus Pinto](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/the-web-application/9781118026472/){:target="_blank"}. Although it's a bit outdated (published in 2011), it is still highly recommended in the community as a valuable resource.

Finally, I leave you with this funny post I came across [on r/ProgrammerHumor](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/k0r22a/sql_injections_are_still_a_problem_in_2255/){:target="_blank"}. I still remember the first time in 2007 when I was reading about SQL Injections as part of my PHP journey. The [documentation](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.mysql-real-escape-string.php){:target="_blank"} said to simply wrap your query within `mysql_real_escape_string()` to mitigate all SQLi risks :); Sadly this attack vector remains relevant in 2023.
