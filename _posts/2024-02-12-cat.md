## Example Commands
* Display file content: `cat filename.txt`
* Create a file: `cat > filename.txt`
* Concatenate multiple files: `cat file1.txt file2.txt > mergedfile.txt`
* Append file content: `cat additional.txt >> existingfile.txt`
* Number lines: `cat -n file.txt`

## Other Useful Options
* `-n`: Numbers all output lines, which is useful for viewing or debugging files with content that needs to be referenced by line number.
* `-s`: Suppresses repeated empty output lines, condensing the output to make it easier to read.
* `-E`: Displays a `$` at the end of each line, making it easier to see line breaks, especially in files with mixed content or trailing spaces.
