## Install Oh My Zsh
<br>
```shell
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```
<br>

## Install Syntax Highlighting and Auto-Suggestions Plugins
<br>
Syntax Highlighting:
<br>

```shell
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-$HOME/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting
```
<br>
Auto-Suggestions:
<br>

```shell
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-$HOME/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions
```
<br>

After cloning, add `zsh-syntax-highlighting` and `zsh-autosuggestions` to the `plugins` section in `~/.zshrc`.
<br>

```sh
plugins=(git zsh-syntax-highlighting zsh-autosuggestions)
```
<br>

## Install and Configure the Powerlevel10k Theme
<br>

Clone the Powerlevel10k repository:


```shell
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-$HOME/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/themes/powerlevel10k
```
<br>

Update the `ZSH_THEME` line in your `~/.zshrc` file to use Powerlevel10k:
<br>

```shell
ZSH_THEME="powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k"
```
<br>
Apply the changes by sourcing `~/.zshrc`:
<br>

```shell
source ~/.zshrc
```
<br>

## Install a Nerd Font
<br>
To fully enjoy Powerlevel10k, you'll need a Nerd Font. Choose and download your preferred Nerd Font from [Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads). Install the font on your system then set it from iTerm2 preferences.
<br>


## Beautifying the `ls` Command with `colorls` Ruby gem
<br>
Install `colorls`:


```shell
sudo gem install colorls
```

<br>
To avoid typing `colorls` every time, we'll create an alias in the `.zshrc` file. This will allow us to use `ls` as a substitute command. Open `~/.zshrc` and add:
<br>

```shell
alias ls='colorls'
```

<br>
**Apply Changes**: For the alias to take effect, source your `.zshrc` file by running:
<br>

```shell
source ~/.zshrc
```
<br>
Et voil√†!
