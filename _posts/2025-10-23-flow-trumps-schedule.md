I think I've changed my mind when it comes to productivity and focus. I've been a huge fan of Cal Newport and his Deep Work philosophy for years now; especially when it comes to minimizing distractions and time boxing my tasks.

However, I recently realized that what we software developers call the flow is inconsistent with what Cal describes as deep work in general.

Flow is this almost meditative state where I am fully immersed in the task at hand, where as deep work is similar in focus but not in "enjoyment"... 

I feel like the joy of the task at hand dictates if its a flow or not.. and I've recently decided that if I am in that zone, and my inspiration is peaked, and for the sake of my soul, everything else cant wait!
