During Covid, my accountant asked me to send him all my tax documents via email; I can only imagine this huge "Downloads" folder on his PC where its a mishmash of all clients data smooshed together.

No, no, no, no.. if they're not using solutions like [Qubes OS](https://www.qubes-os.org){:target="_blank"}; or have an EDR in place, no thank you;  I will print them the old fashioned way.. and finally start to file them myself :)

Now, be right back while I fax my medical records to my doctor.
