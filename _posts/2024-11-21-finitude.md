Many authors have discussed the hidden secrets to achieving mastery, from renowned writers to the average youtuber recycling clichéd advice and offering "all the secrets" if we just follow their process (and, of course, buy their $19.99 course).  

It seems that most people perceive the path to mastery in extremes. Some believe in Malcolm Gladwell’s 10,000 hour rule.

Others lean heavily on focus and time management, as Cal Newport suggests in *Deep Work*. 

On the other hand, David Epstein, in *Range*, advocates for the opposite: broadening your skill set and generalizing your talents.

Oliver Burkeman, focuses on our finitude and the realization that we will never achieve all our plans:
> “We’ve been granted the mental capacities to make almost infinitely ambitious plans, yet practically no time at all to put them into action.”  
> *Oliver Burkeman, Four Thousand Weeks*  

My perspective on this is constantly evolving; I highly recommend Professor Richard Hamming’s talk, *[You and Your Research](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1zDuOPkMSw)*. He advises asking yourself: *What is the most important problem in your field, and why aren’t you working on it?*  

 However, the more I think about it.. the more I procrastinate on doing what matters.
