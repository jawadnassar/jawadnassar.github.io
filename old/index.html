	<p>I'm Jawad Nassar, a computer science fresh graduate, living in Beirut, Lebanon. Self proclaimed geek, fascinated by the Web and slowly becoming a developer.</p>
	<p>I've been studying and writing code for many years and still love and enjoy every minute of it.</p>
	<p>I'll be blogging about any experiment, tutorial or project that I'll find interesting to share.</p>
